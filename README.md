## Introduction

This plugin can be used to determine the next release version based on previous tags and the commit messages used.  
It calculates the version number based on the format of the commit message.  
The commit message format used is [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Getting started

This plugin can be used in a pipeline in a stage or the environment block.  Some examples of this in use are:

### In the environment block

```
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        NEXT_VERSION = nextVersion()
    }

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo "next version = ${NEXT_VERSION}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Use with prerelease information
For a `1.0.0` existing version the following code :

```
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        NEXT_VERSION = nextVersion(prerelease: 'alpha')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo "next version = ${NEXT_VERSION}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Will display :`next version = 1.1.0-alpha`
